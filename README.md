This is your file structure for the exercises and tests for React.js Crash Course.

The description of exercises could be found inside corresponding folders, for example for Block 01 it will be inside `03_react/block01/react01description.md` file

---

IN ORDER TO TEST YOUR SOLUTIONS YOU SHOULD RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND IN FOLDER 03_react IN THE TERMINAL:

- Execute tests from 03_react folder

  > sh react_tests/react_b1ex1.sh

The last command will create and execute each test file on exercise 1 from block 1. In the same manner to run a test on exercise 2 from block 1 you need to change the numbers in the command:

  > sh react_tests/react_b1ex2.sh


In order to be able to test an exercise you need to create the exercise accordingly:

# Example for block01 > ex01:

- Create the react app with the name ex01

  > create-react-app ex01

# or

# For block03 > ex02 inside block03 folder:

> create-react-app ex02



Have fun!!!
